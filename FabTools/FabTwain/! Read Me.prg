This lib is the result of a work I've done in my "teacher-work" with/for my students.
Originally, some part were in C++, but to be fine with Twain, I have done all work with VO.

If you need more info, I suggest that you get the latest Twain specs at www.twain.org.
You can find a .pdf file that will give many info and code pieces. ( That I've used to build this lib)

You can use this lib. with VO-GUI or ClassMate without any modifications as no other lib is needed !!

Any comments or bug reports are welcome
